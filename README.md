This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Use without an account to create a playlist quickly

Despite utilizing Firebase Realtime DB for saving playlists and videos, this is completely optional and those who merely wish to create a playlist on the fly may do so. If you create a playlist without creating an account, the playlist will not be saved anywhere. Link for the website, I suggest using Chrome: https://users.metropolia.fi/~ottojaa/angular-jukebox/


## User account and realtime DB

Uses your account for the sole purpose of saving the users' playlist data on the cloud. 

## Mobile

Developing a mobile version is plausible, if I can circumvent the youtube Data API stopping as soon as the user hits lockscreen. Not currently planned.

## Feedback

Please give feedback if you have any! Some of the code is still quite messy and there are bugs to be found. All pull requests are welcome!
