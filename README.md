# AngularJukebox

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Use without an account to create a playlist quickly

Despite utilizing Firebase Realtime DB for saving playlists and videos, this is completely optional and those who merely wish to create a playlist on the fly may do so.


## User account and realtime DB

Uses your account for the sole purpose of saving the users' playlist data on the cloud. 

## Mobile? TBD

Might get on this once (if) I figure how to force youtube to play on background with browsers, or do a quick Ionic / Cordova conversion and make an app for it. Currently not planned

## Feedback

Please give feedback if you have any! Some of the code is still quite messy and there are bugs to be found. All pull requests are welcome!
